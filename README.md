=====================================================

            

 


Processes a webhook sent from an Azure alert.

This Azure Automation sample runbook runs on Azure to process an alert sent
through a webhook. It converts the RequestBody into a Python object
by loading the json string sent in.

You can set up an alert for an Automation runbook by following the document
on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-alert-triggered-runbook

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
